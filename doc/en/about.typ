= About This Guide
<about>
QSoC is a comprehensive System-on-Chip (SoC) design tool that provides both
graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) for creating,
managing, and generating SoC components. This tool enables efficient SoC design
by providing features for project management, module library management, bus
interface handling, schematic processing, and RTL generation.

The tool is designed to streamline the SoC development process by offering
integrated capabilities for importing and managing Verilog modules, handling
bus interfaces, and generating RTL code. It supports both interactive GUI-based
design and automated command-line operations, making it suitable for various
development workflows and automation scenarios.
